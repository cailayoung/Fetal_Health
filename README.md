# Fetal_Health
Using ML to predict fetal health and develop risk score for fetal morbidity/mortality.

This project uses machine learning in Python to make a qualitative (Normal, Suspect, or Pathological) and quantitative (scaled 0-5) assessment of the health of a fetus using data from a fetal health classifications dataset (Ayres de Campos et al. (2000) SisPorto 2.0 A Program for Automated Analysis of Cardiotocograms. J Matern Fetal Med 5:311-318).
